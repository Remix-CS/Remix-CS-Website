Or what it’s like to work at a company like Google? Technology and computer science is an extremely broad field. This track will provide you with an overview of it. You’ll learn more about different career paths within technology and various popular topics in technology (i.e., artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, how social media works, tech ethics).
